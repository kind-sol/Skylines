# **WHY SMART CITY?**

Smart cities are designed to use technology and data to improve the quality of life for their citizens and make urban areas more efficient and sustainable. There are many potential benefits to creating a smart city, including:

- **Improved public services**: Smart cities can use data and technology to improve the delivery of public services, such as healthcare, education, and public transportation.
- **Economic development**: Smart cities can attract businesses and investment, as well as talented workers, by offering a modern and efficient infrastructure.
- **Quality of life**: Smart cities can use technology and data to improve the safety, health, and well-being of their citizens.
- **Sustainability**: Smart cities can use technology to reduce their environmental impact and become more sustainable.

# **ACTUAL CONTEXT**

The new global problems require cooperation and innovation but the systems have not innovated.
There is a real difficulty in accessing public data by citizens and also by public servants and we have lack of data to be analyzed and used to improve certain urban services.

It is projected that the global urban population will continue to grow significantly between 2020 and 2050. According to the United Nations, the urban population is expected to increase by about 2.5 billion people between 2020 and 2050, with almost 90% of the growth occurring in Asia and Africa. By 2050, it is estimated that about 68% of the global population will live in urban areas, up from about 55% in 2020.

</center>
This rapid urbanization is being driven by a number of factors, including population growth, rural-to-urban migration, and the expansion of existing cities. As more people move to urban areas, it is important for cities to be well-planned and equipped to handle the additional population and the accompanying infrastructure needs.

There are many potential factors that can impact a city following a rapid urbanization:

- **Environmental degradation**: Urbanization can also have negative impacts, such as environmental degradation, as the expansion of cities often involves the loss of natural habitats and the increased use of natural resources.

- **Traffic congestion and air pollution**: Urbanization can lead to increased traffic congestion and air pollution, as more people and vehicles compete for space in the city.

_How can we improve it?_

It is generally not possible to completely stop urbanization, as it is a natural process that is driven by a variety of factors, including population growth, economic development, and the desire for a higher quality of life. However, there are ways to manage urbanization and address its negative impacts:

- **Sustainable infrastructure**: Cities can invest in sustainable infrastructure, such as energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy sources, to reduce their environmental impact.
- **Public transportation**: Cities can invest in public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and bike-sharing programs, to reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility.
- **Smart growth**: Cities can adopt smart growth policies that focus on compact, walkable, and transit-oriented development, which can reduce the negative impacts of urbanization, such as traffic congestion and sprawl.

# **OUR VISION**

We aim for most cities to have better economic growth, more efficient urban mobility, better quality of life for citizens, sustainable development, all through the use of a robust technology. Our solution will aim to improve operations for control and command systems targeting the transition from C1 into C2 or higher.

Control systems are used to monitor and control the operation of a system in real-time. They use **sensors** to collect data about the system's **operation**, and use this **data** to adjust the system's behavior in order to achieve a desired outcome.

**C1**, **C2**, and other similar terms are often used to classify control and command systems based on the level of complexity and autonomy they provide.

**C1** systems are the most basic level of control and command systems. They are typically manual systems that require a human operator to manually control and monitor the system.

**C2** systems are more advanced than C1 systems and provide some level of automation and/or computer assistance to the operator. They may include features such as automatic data collection and analysis, or the ability to execute pre-programmed tasks.

**C3** systems are more complex and autonomous than C2 systems. They are able to make decisions on their own and may include features such as machine learning algorithms that allow them to adapt to changing conditions.

**C4** systems are the most advanced level of control and command systems. They are fully autonomous systems that are able to operate without human intervention.

These categories are generally used to describe the level of complexity and autonomy of control and command systems, with **C1** systems being the most basic and **C4** systems being the most advanced.

Specifically, a control system might be used to regulate the temperature of a manufacturing process, or to adjust the flow of electricity in a power grid. There are many **scenarios** that can be **automated** in a smart city, as the use of technology and data can help to optimize a wide range of city operations and services. Here are a few scenarios to be automated in a smart city:

- **Traffic management**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to monitor and manage traffic flow, adjusting traffic signals and other elements of the transportation system in real-time to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.
  Public transportation: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to optimize the routes and schedules of public transportation systems, such as buses and trains, in order to improve efficiency and reduce wait times.
- **Energy management**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to monitor and optimize energy use, such as by controlling lighting and heating in public buildings, or by adjusting the output of renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines.
- **Waste management**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to optimize the collection and processing of waste, such as by routing waste trucks more efficiently or by automating the sorting and recycling of materials.
- **Public safety**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to monitor and respond to public safety incidents, such as fires, accidents, or crimes, and to optimize the deployment of emergency response resources.
 **Healthcare**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to monitor and optimize the delivery of healthcare services, such as by automating the scheduling of appointments or the ordering of medication.
- **Building management**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to optimize the management of buildings, such as by automating the control of lighting, heating, and security systems, or by monitoring and managing energy use.
- **Government services**: Smart cities can use sensors and data analytics to optimize the delivery of government services, such as by automating the processing of applications and requests, or by providing real-time updates and information to citizens.

Also, a smart city can use technology to automate traffic lights in order to optimize response to an incident. This can be done using sensors and data analytics to monitor traffic conditions in real-time and adjust the timing of traffic lights accordingly.

For example, if an accident or other incident occurs on a particular stretch of road, sensors can detect the increased traffic congestion and adjust the timing of traffic lights to allow more time for vehicles to pass through the affected area. This can help to reduce delays and improve traffic flow, as well as improve safety by minimizing the risk of additional accidents.

**These kind of scenarios can be automated** using an **intelligent transportation system (ITS)**

##### The architecture of an ITS typically includes the following components:

- **Sensors**: These are devices that are installed in the transportation network to collect data about traffic conditions, such as traffic volume, speed, and vehicle type. Sensors can include traffic cameras, loop detectors, and other types of sensors.
- **Data collection and management**: This component is responsible for collecting and storing the data generated by the sensors in a central database or data warehouse.
- **Data analytics**: This component uses algorithms and other techniques to analyze the data collected by the sensors and generate insights and recommendations for improving the performance of the transportation system.
- **Communication and control**: This component is responsible for transmitting data and recommendations from the data analytics component to the appropriate parties, such as traffic management centers or public transportation operators. It can also be used to control traffic signals and other elements of the transportation system in real-time.
- **User interface**: This component provides a user-friendly interface for users such as traffic managers, public transportation operators, and drivers to access and interact with the system.

However, the specific features and capabilities of systems within each category can vary widely depending on the specific application.

## **DATA COLLECTION**

### Architecture for the data collection and management layer of a system:

- **Data sources**: These are the various sources of data that are collected by the system, such as sensors, databases, or APIs.
- **Data connectors**: These are the components that are responsible for connecting to the data sources and extracting the data. They may use various protocols and technologies, such as SQL, REST, or MQTT, to connect to the data sources.
- **Data storage**: This component is responsible for storing the data collected by the system. It may use a variety of storage technologies, such as a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a data lake.
- **Data transformation**: This component is responsible for cleaning, formatting, and transforming the data collected by the system in order to make it more suitable for analysis and reporting.
- **Data access**: This component is responsible for providing access to the data stored by the system. It may include APIs, data marts, or other mechanisms for accessing the data.

Overall, this architecture is designed to enable the efficient collection, storage, and access of data from various sources in a centralized location. It allows the system to process and analyze the data in order to extract insights and make informed decisions.

### **There are several steps involved in collecting sensor data**:

**Choose the appropriate sensors**: The first step in collecting sensor data is to choose the sensors that are appropriate for the application. Sensors come in a wide range of types and sizes, and each type of sensor is best suited to certain types of data collection. For example, a temperature sensor would be a good choice for collecting temperature data, while a pressure sensor would be a good choice for collecting pressure data.

**Install the sensors**: Once the appropriate sensors have been chosen, they must be installed in the location where they will be used. This may involve physically mounting the sensors on a structure or device, or embedding them in a system or process.

**Connect the sensors to a data acquisition system**: In order to collect data from the sensors, they must be connected to a data acquisition system. This may involve wiring the sensors to a data logger, computer, or other device that is capable of collecting and storing the data.

**Configure the data acquisition system**: The data acquisition system must be configured to collect the data from the sensors. This may involve setting up the system to collect data at specific intervals, or to trigger data collection based on certain conditions.

**Collect the data**: Once the sensors and data acquisition system are set up, the data can be collected. This may involve running the system for a specific period of time, or continuously collecting data until the system is stopped.

**Analyze the data**: Once the data has been collected, it can be analyzed to extract insights and make decisions based on the data. This may involve using software tools to visualize the data, or applying statistical analysis techniques to the data.

The architecture of a data acquisition system refers to the overall design and structure of the system, including the hardware and software components that are used to collect, process, and store data.

#### **One of the most common data acquisition system architecture includes the following components**:

**Sensors**: These are the devices that are used to collect data from the environment or system being monitored. Sensors may be connected to the data acquisition system directly, or they may be connected to a remote device that transmits the data wirelessly.

**Data acquisition hardware**: This is the hardware that is used to connect the sensors to the data acquisition system and to collect the data from the sensors. Data acquisition hardware may include data loggers, analog-to-digital converters, and other types of hardware.

**Data acquisition software**: This is the software that is used to configure the data acquisition system, collect the data from the sensors, and store the data for later analysis. Data acquisition software may include software libraries, drivers, and other tools.

**Communication infrastructure**: This is the hardware and software that is used to transmit the data from the sensors to the data acquisition system. Communication infrastructure may include wired or wireless networks, communication protocols, and other components.

**Data storage and analysis**: This is the hardware and software that is used to store the data for later analysis and to process the data to extract insights. Data storage and analysis may include database systems, data warehousing systems, and data analysis tools.

Overall, the architecture of a data acquisition system is designed to enable the efficient and reliable collection, processing, and storage of data from a variety of sources.

**Skylines** is our solution for creating web-based interactive, data-driven visualizations using various sources of data that are collected by the system. It is particularly well-suited for rendering large datasets, such as geospatial data.

### **DATA MANIPULATION**

#### **Data collection**

#### **There are multiple ways of data collection**:

**Collecting raw data from sensors** : The first step in collecting sensor data is to collect the raw data from the sensors. This may involve using data acquisition hardware or software to collect the data, or using communication protocols to transmit the data wirelessly.

**Accessing data through an API** : Typically involves making a request to the API using a specific URL or endpoint, along with any required authentication or authorization credentials. The API will then respond with the requested data, which can be in various formats such as JSON, XML, or CSV.

#### **Data process**

**Pre-process the raw data**: Depending on the specific needs of the application, the raw data may need to be pre-processed in order to clean or transform it. This may involve removing errors or inconsistencies in the data, aggregating the data to a specific level of detail, or applying calculations or other transformations to the data. **Skylines** uses its own custom parsing mechanism that cleans and categorizes the data.

**Convert the data to a suitable format:** The data may need to be converted to a specific format in order to be stored or transmitted. For example, the data may need to be converted to a binary format, a CSV file, or a JSON file.

**Store the data:** The data can then be stored in a suitable location, such as a database, a file system, or a cloud storage service.

**Analyze the data**: Once the data has been collected and stored, it can be analyzed to extract insights and make decisions based on the data. This may involve using software tools to visualize the data, or applying statistical analysis techniques to the data.

### **Overview**

#### Here is a flowchart that illustrates a pipeline for cleaning, formatting, and transforming OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to be used in Skylines:

- **Extract OSM data**: The first step in the pipeline is to extract the relevant OSM data from the OSM database or API. This may involve using filters or queries to select specific data elements, such as roads, buildings, or points of interest.

- **Clean and filter data**: The next step is to clean and filter the data to remove any invalid or unnecessary elements. This may involve identifying and removing duplicate or incorrect data, as well as filtering out data that is not needed for the specific use case.

- **Transform data**: The next step is to transform the data into a format that is suitable for use in Skylines. This may involve converting the data from its original format (such as XML or JSON) into a format that Skylines can understand, such as GeoJSON or a custom JSON format.
- **Load data into Skylines**: The final step is to load the transformed data into Skylines using the appropriate data loading function, such as GeoJsonLayer or ArcLayer. The data can then be visualized and interacted with in Skylines.

**Skylines** use custom layers that are capable of rendering GeoJSON data passing the OSM data to Osmium and instructed it to export the data in GeoJSON format. This can be done using one of the built-in geospatial layers provided by the system.

The application allows to add multiple layers to a map and each layer can be a separated GeoJSON files which are used for encoding a variety of geographic data structures, including points, lines, and polygons.

The structure of a file, is a collection of key-value pairs, with the key being the type of feature and the value being the feature's properties and geometry.

#### **There are multiple types of GeoJSON feature**:

**Point**: A single point on a map, represented by a set of coordinates (longitude and latitude)

**LineString**: A set of two or more points that are connected by a line.

**Polygon**: A set of points that define a closed shape.

**MultiPoint**: An array of Point features.

**MultiLineString**: An array of LineString features.

**MultiPolygon**: An array of Polygon features.

```json
{
  // Polygon example:
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [100.0, 0.0], // [x, y]
        [101.0, 0.0],
        [101.0, 1.0],
        [100.0, 1.0],
        [100.0, 0.0]
      ]
    ]
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "Polygon"
      // ... relevant info
    }
  ]
}
```

One of the core features of **Skylines** is the ability to generate **custom layers**, which can be used to display data in various formats and styles.

To customize a Skylines layer, you can pass various options to the layer's manager. Some common options include:

**data**: The data to be displayed in the layer, typically in the form of an array of objects.

**getPosition**: A function that returns the position of each data point, typically in the form of an array of [longitude, latitude] coordinates.

**getColor**: A function that returns the color of each data point, typically in the form of an array of **[r, g, b, a]** values.

**getRadius**: A function that returns the radius of each data point, typically in the form of a number.

Once you have created a geospatial layer, you can pass your GeoJSON data to the layer as a data source. The layer will then process the data and use it to create the visualization.

To display the visualization, you can add the layer to a component, along with any other layers that you want to include in the visualization. The **Skylines** component will then render the visualization to the page, using an API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within web browsers, to draw the data efficiently and interactively.

### **Data Visualization**

_What we can view?_

**Traffic flow**
**Public transportation**

The workflow for creating visualizations with Skylines involves the following steps:

**Acquire and prepare the data**: This step involves getting the data you want to visualize in the proper format and structure. **Skylines** supports a wide range of data formats, including CSV, JSON, and GeoJSON.

**Choose a layer: Skylines** provides a set of layers for visualizing different types of data, such as points, lines, and polygons. You'll need to choose the layer that best fits the data you're working with.

**Customize the layer**: Once you've chosen a layer, you can customize it to fit your needs. This might involve setting properties like **color**, **size**, and **opacity**, or adding custom data fields to the layer.

**Add the layer to the map**: Once you've customized the layer, you can add it to the map by creating an instance of the layer and passing it to the map view.

Interact with the data: **Skylines** provides a set of tools for interacting with the data in the visualization. This might include **zooming** and **panning**, **selecting data points**, or **adding filters** and **legends** to the visualization.

#### **Supported layer types:**
Skylines uses different categories of layers to organize and display data. The categories of layers include:

**Core Layers:** The core layers are a set of foundational layers that serve as the foundation for creating various types of data visualizations. These layers are designed to be flexible and generic in purpose, and can be used to represent a wide range of data, making them suitable for building a variety of visualizations. They are considered the building blocks for all data visualizations and provide a wide range of functionality, making it easy to create interactive, rich visualizations with Skylines.

### **Analyze the data using neural networks**
Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected "neurons" which process and transmit information. Neural networks are particularly well-suited to tasks that involve recognizing patterns or making decisions based on input data.

Neural networks can be implemented in a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and others. Some popular libraries and frameworks for implementing neural networks in Python include **TensorFlow, Keras**, and **PyTorch**. These libraries provide pre-built neural network architectures and a variety of tools for training, testing, and deploying neural networks.

Neural networks can help a city to improve into a smart city by providing insights into different aspects of the city, such as traffic, energy consumption, air quality, and crime. By analyzing data collected from sensors, cameras, and other sources, neural networks can identify patterns and trends that can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve the city's infrastructure and services.

For example, a neural network could be trained on traffic data to predict traffic congestion, which could then be used to optimize traffic flow and reduce travel time. Similarly, a neural network could be trained on energy consumption data to predict energy usage, which could then be used to reduce energy consumption and costs. Neural networks can also be used to analyze video footage from cameras to identify crime hotspots, which can then be used to increase patrols in those areas.

Neural networks can also be used to predict the weather and air quality and to predict the areas where air pollution is more likely to happen, allowing the city to take preventative measures to reduce pollution.

Additionally, neural networks can also be used to predict future population growth and housing demand, which can be used to inform decisions about housing construction and development.

**Traffic accidents**: Neural networks could be trained on data from traffic cameras and sensors to identify patterns that are indicative of an accident, such as sudden changes in speed or sudden stops.

**Crime**: Neural networks could be trained on data from surveillance cameras and other sources to identify patterns that are indicative of criminal activity, such as suspicious behavior or the presence of weapons.

**Fires**: Neural networks could be trained on data from thermal cameras and other sensors to identify patterns that are indicative of a fire, such as heat signatures or smoke.
Natural disasters: Neural networks could be trained on data from weather sensors and other sources to identify patterns that are indicative of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes.

**Water leaks**: Neural networks could be trained on data from water sensors and other sources to identify patterns that are indicative of a water leak, such as changes in pressure or unexpected spikes in water usage.

**Gas leaks**: Neural networks could be trained on data from gas sensors and other sources to identify patterns that are indicative of a gas leak, such as changes in pressure or unusual spikes in gas usage.

**Environmental hazards**: Neural networks could be trained on data from environmental sensors and other sources to identify patterns that are indicative of environmental hazards, such as high levels of pollution or the presence of toxic substances.

**Public health emergencies:** Neural networks could be trained on data from public health sources, such as hospitals and clinics, to identify patterns that are indicative of public health emergencies, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases.

**Cybersecurity threats**: Neural networks could be trained on data from cybersecurity systems to identify patterns that are indicative of cyber attacks or other cybersecurity threats.

**In Python**, implementing a neural network typically involves the following steps:

- Importing the necessary libraries and loading the data
- Preprocessing the data, such as normalizing or scaling the input features
- Defining the neural network architecture, typically using a library like **TensorFlow** or **Keras**
- Training the neural network on the preprocessed data
- Evaluating the performance of the trained neural network on a test set
- Using the trained neural network to make predictions on new data.

Here is an example of code using Python and neural networks to address traffic congestion or identify an accident:

```
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Loading the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("traffic_data.csv")

# Preprocessing the data
X = data.drop(["congestion", "accident"], axis=1)
y = data[["congestion", "accident"]]
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Splitting the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Building the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compiling the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)

# Evaluating the model on the test set
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("Test accuracy:", test_acc)
```

This code uses a dataset containing information about traffic conditions, such as traffic volume, speed, and weather conditions. The data is preprocessed and split into training and test sets. A neural network model is built using the Keras library, with two output nodes, one for congestion and one for accident. The model is trained using the training data and then evaluated using the test data. The final output is the accuracy of the model in identifying congestion and accident.

Here is an example of code using a more complex architecture, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), to address traffic congestion or identify an accident using Python and deep learning techniques:

```
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Loading the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("traffic_data.csv")

# Preprocessing the data
X = data.drop(["congestion", "accident"], axis=1)
y = data[["congestion", "accident"]]
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
X = X.reshape(-1, 32, 32, 1) # reshape the data to fit the CNN input

# Splitting the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Building the convolutional neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compiling the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)

# Evaluating the model on the test set
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("Test accuracy:", test_acc)
```

The model is trained using the training data and then evaluated using the test data. The final output is the accuracy of the model in identifying congestion and accident.

Overall, neural networks are powerful tools that can help cities to become more efficient, sustainable, and livable by providing insights into different aspects of the city, such as traffic, energy consumption, air quality, and crime, which can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve the city's infrastructure and services.
### Data security and integrity
To ensure the security and integrity of data we follow best practices protecting both the privacy of individuals and the integrity of the data used to drive decisions and inform policy.

**Encrypt sensitive data**: All sensitive data, including personal information, should be encrypted in transit and at rest. This will prevent unauthorized access to the data and ensure that the data cannot be easily compromised.

**Secure authentication and authorization**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to secure the app and ensure that only authorized users have access to the data. Additionally, **implement role-based authorization to restrict access to sensitive data only to those users who need it**.

**Regularly backup data**: Regular backups of data can help ensure that even if data is lost or compromised, you have a copy that can be used to restore the data.

**Use secure infrastructure**: Ensure that the infrastructure used to store and process data is secure, including the use of secure servers, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

**Conduct regular security assessments**: Regular security assessments can help identify potential vulnerabilities in the app and the infrastructure, allowing you to take steps to remediate them before they can be exploited by attackers.

**Train employees on security best practices**: Ensure that employees and users of the app understand the importance of data security and are trained on how to follow best practices for keeping data secure.

**Follow legal and regulatory requirements**: Be aware of and comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements for data protection, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Our application involves the processing of personal data of EU citizens, comply with the GDPR, as well as any other relevant data protection laws in Romania. When collecting personal data through Skylines application, we only collect the data that is necessary for the specific purpose of the application, avoid collecting excessive or unnecessary data, and should always be transparent with individuals about what data is being collected and why.

Once we have collected personal data, it's important to properly secure it to protect the privacy of individuals. This includes implementing technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of the data.

To ensure compliance with the GDPR, we use processes to delete personal data once it is no longer needed for the purpose it was collected, or if the individual requests its deletion.
